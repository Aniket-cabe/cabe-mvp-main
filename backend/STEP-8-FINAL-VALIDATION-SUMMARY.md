## ðŸ“ˆ Validation Results

### Point System Verification: âœ… 100% PASS
- All 4 skill configurations found
- All weighting features implemented
- All skill multipliers correctly configured
- All skill caps correctly configured
- All utility functions implemented
- All skill weights correctly configured
- All calculation features implemented
- All fairness analysis features implemented

### Key Features Verified:
1. **Skill-Specific Weightings**: Each skill has unique base and bonus multipliers
2. **Dynamic Caps**: Different point caps for each skill category
3. **Fairness Analysis**: 20% variance threshold for fair point distribution
4. **Utility Functions**: Complete set of helper functions for skill management
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Default configuration for unknown skills

## ðŸŽ¯ Fairness Analysis

The updated point system ensures fair point distribution across skills:

- **Cloud Computing & DevOps**: Highest points (1.3x base, 2400 cap)
- **AI / Machine Learning**: High points (1.25x base, 2300 cap)
- **Full-Stack Software Development**: Good points (1.2x base, 2200 cap)
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Standard points (1.15x base, 2100 cap)

The system maintains fairness by:
- Using skill-specific weightings based on complexity and market demand
- Implementing variance analysis to detect unfair distributions
- Providing recommendations for adjustments when needed
- Ensuring all skills have reasonable point ranges

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/lib/points.ts` - Complete point system overhaul

### Files Created:
