## 🤖 AI-Powered Reasoning Engine

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

The system generates comprehensive prompts that include:

1. **Task Context**: Title, skill area, difficulty level, scores
2. **Submission Details**: Code, proof, description, context
3. **Analysis Requirements**: Specific factors to consider
4. **Output Format**: Structured reasoning requirements

### Example Analysis Factors

- Code quality vs. functionality assessment differences
- Complexity evaluation variations
- Skill area-specific evaluation criteria
- Task difficulty expectations
- Code length vs. quality trade-offs
- Documentation and explanation quality
- Best practices adherence

### Reasoning Output Structure

The AI generates detailed analysis explaining:

1. Why the deviation occurred
2. Whether it represents a legitimate difference or potential error
3. What factors most likely contributed to the discrepancy
4. Recommendations for addressing similar cases

## 🎯 Action Recommendation System

### Decision Matrix

| Deviation Type | Expert Tasks    | AI/ML Tasks     | Other Tasks     | Recommended Action |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **None**       | -               | -               | -               | Allow              |
| **Minor**      | Flag for Review | Flag for Review | Allow           | Context-dependent  |
| **Major**      | Flag for Review | Flag for Review | Flag for Review | Flag for Review    |
| **Critical**   | Escalate        | Escalate        | Escalate        | Escalate           |

### Action Types

1. **Allow**: No action required, scores are within acceptable variance
2. **Flag for Review**: Submission requires human review for final decision
3. **Escalate**: Critical issue requiring immediate attention and potential system review
4. **Override**: Manual override of automated decision (rare, requires admin approval)

## 🔍 Risk Factor Analysis

### Automatic Risk Detection

The system automatically identifies risk factors including:

- **High Score Discrepancy**: Deviations > 20 points
- **Skill Area Complexity**: AI/ML evaluation complexity, subjective content evaluation
- **Task Difficulty**: Expert-level task complexity
- **Code Quality Indicators**: Minimal code submissions, very short completion times
- **Score Patterns**: Potential inflation (user > 90, AI < 60) or deflation (user < 30, AI > 70)

### Risk Factor Examples

```typescript
// Score inflation pattern
if (userSubmittedScore > 90 && aiAuditScore < 60) {
  riskFactors.push('Potential score inflation');
}

// Minimal submission
if (submissionContext?.codeLength && submissionContext.codeLength < 100) {
  riskFactors.push('Minimal code submission');
}

// Expert task with deviation
if (taskDifficulty === 'expert' && deviationMagnitude > 10) {
  riskFactors.push('Expert-level task complexity');
}
```

## 📈 Batch Analysis Capabilities

### Pattern Detection

The system can analyze multiple submissions to identify:

- **Skill Area Patterns**: Average deviations by skill area
- **Difficulty Patterns**: Deviation trends by task difficulty
- **Critical Issues**: Systemic problems requiring attention
- **Scoring Bias**: Consistent over/under-scoring patterns

### Batch Analysis Example

```typescript
const batchResult = await batchAnalyzeDeviations(submissions);

console.log('Deviation Type Distribution:');
// { none: 5, minor: 3, major: 2, critical: 1 }

console.log('Critical Issues:');
// ['1 critical deviations detected requiring immediate attention']

console.log('Suggested Actions:');
// { allow: 5, flag_for_review: 4, escalate: 1 }
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { analyzeDeviation } from '../src/utils/deviation-analyzer';

const input: DeviationAnalysisInput = {
  taskTitle: 'Build a React component',
  taskDifficulty: 'medium',
  skillArea: 'frontend',
  userSubmittedScore: 85,
  aiAuditScore: 72,
  userCode: 'const Component = () => <div>Hello World</div>;',
  userProof: 'Created a simple React component',
  submissionContext: {
    timeSpent: 30,
    codeLength: 50,
    complexity: 'low',
  },
};

const result = await analyzeDeviation(input);
console.log(`Deviation Type: ${result.deviationType}`);
console.log(`Reasoning: ${result.reasoning}`);
console.log(`Suggested Action: ${result.suggestedAction}`);
```

### Integration with Existing Audit System

```typescript
import { analyzeDeviation } from '../src/utils/deviation-analyzer';
import { runScoringAudit } from '../src/utils/scoring-audit';

// Run standard audit
const auditResult = await runScoringAudit();

// Analyze deviations for flagged submissions
for (const result of auditResult.results) {
  if (result.status !== '✅ PASS') {
    const deviationInput: DeviationAnalysisInput = {
      taskTitle: result.submissionId,
      taskDifficulty: 'medium', // Would come from task metadata
      skillArea: result.skill,
      userSubmittedScore: result.expectedScore,
      aiAuditScore: result.actualScore,
    };

    const deviationResult = await analyzeDeviation(deviationInput);

    if (deviationResult.suggestedAction === 'escalate') {
      // Send to admin review queue
      await escalateForReview(result.submissionId, deviationResult);
    }
  }
}
```
